# ML-Celeb-Detector
The ML-Celeb-Detector is a project that utilizes the powerful Keras VGGFace model to create an intelligent system capable of recognizing a set of celebrity faces. The repository contains code and resources that enable the user to input an image of their choice and the system will identify the closest celebrity match. The Keras VGGFace model is a deep learning model that is designed to recognize facial features in images. 

To use the system, the user simply needs to upload an image, and the system will run the model on the inputted image and compare the image to the trained database of celebrity faces. The system will then provide the user with the name and image of the closest celebrity match.

In this demo, I add an image of a celebrity lookalike and the model correctly detects the celebrity, Salman Khan.
